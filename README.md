# Jarvis

Personal Mac assistant. The full plan is in `Jarvis Features and Build Spec.pdf`.

## Run Jarvis (phase 1, in progress)

`npm start` opens the orb at the bottom right of the screen. Jarvis starts asleep: say "Hey Jarvis" (or
"Jarvis, what time is it?") to wake it, then just talk. "Go to sleep, Jarvis" or "Stop listening" sends it back to sleep, and so do two minutes of silence.
Needs the keys in `.env`, `brew install whisper-cpp` and the speech model in `models/` (steps below).

- Ctrl+Option+J turns the microphone off and on.
- Ctrl+Option+S stops Jarvis talking.
- Right-click the orb to quit. Drag it to move it.

Orb colours: dim blue is asleep, bright blue is awake or speaking, mint is hearing you, violet is thinking, grey is microphone off, red is an error.

`JARVIS_SELFTEST=1 npx electron .` (after `npm run build`) makes Jarvis ask itself a question and answer it, then quit.

## Phase 0: model speed test

Measures how fast each chosen NVIDIA model starts replying, using the API keys in turn.

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and paste the keys (comma-separated). `.env` is never committed.
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run speed`

## Phase 0: voice and listening speed test

Kokoro speaks five sentences, whisper.cpp transcribes them, and the transcripts must match.

1. `brew install whisper-cpp ffmpeg`
2. Download the speech model (490 MB, English only) into `models/`, which is never committed:
   `curl -L --fail -o models/ggml-small.en.bin https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/resolve/main/ggml-small.en.bin`
3. `npm run voice` (the first run also downloads the Kokoro voice, about 330 MB)

`npm run check` type-checks the code and runs the tests. Needs Node 24 or newer.
